"""QGym cloud training as a marimo notebook (runs on MoLab).

The marimo port of ``notebooks/colab_train.ipynb``: clone/refresh the repo,
install the locked GPU dependency graph with uv, train, then download the
checkpoints as a zip.

    uv run marimo edit notebooks/molab_train.py     # local
    # MoLab: upload this file to molab.marimo.io, pick a GPU runtime, run.

Only marimo itself is imported here; the repo and its dependencies live in a
separate uv environment driven through subprocess, exactly as in the Colab
notebook. Disconnect the runtime when you are done or it keeps burning compute.

How to use it: run the cells in order. Parameters live in their own cell above
each step -- edit the constants, run that cell, then run the step below it. A
step that fails raises, so a red cell means stop and read the log rather than
carry on. Nothing runs on its own, and nothing re-runs behind your back.
